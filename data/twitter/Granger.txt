@justinfastert @isufarmer @HeishmanAg True.
@isufarmer @justinfastert @HeishmanAg Ok. Been reading other comments. But still, lots of rent between $275 and $300+
@justinfastert @HeishmanAg Omg. How does that even pencil out? Lots of $500+ and one at $800? Doesn’t make sense
@HeishmanAg Where the hell is that?
